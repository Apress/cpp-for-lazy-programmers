################# Explanation: ############################
#g++/gcc -MM produces a pattern like so:
#       main.o: main.cc include1.h include2.h
#  listing the .o file and all it depends on. We also want the .dep file
#  to depend on itself:
#       main.o main.dep: main.cc include1.h include2.h
#  so if an include changes, main.dep will have to update itself
#  Otherwise if you alter include1.h, say, you rebuild the .o but not the .dep
#     and if include1.h now includes some other file, we needed to add that
#  Now it will
