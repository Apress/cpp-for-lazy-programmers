To create your own programs with SSDL, see the newWork folder.

========== How to use example SSDL programs ====================

Microsoft Visual Studio:

To run example programs with Microsoft Visual Studio, open SSDL_Project.sln 
in the chapter folder.  If you are using Visual Studio 2019, accept its offer to
upgrade the solution.

To run a particular project, either right-click on the project and select 
Debug > Start New Instance; or right-click on the project and select Set as 
Startup Project, then run as you usually would a Visual Studio project.


MinGW:

To run example programs with MinGW, 
  go the the project folder; 
  copy Makefile.mingw to Makefile; 
  make; and enter 
  bash mingw.  
To debug,
  bash gdbw.

Unix:

To run example programs with Unix, 
  go the the project folder; 
  copy Makefile.unix to Makefile; 
  make; and enter 
  ./runx
To debug,
  ./dddx or ./gdbx.
If those last two files are not present you can copy them from newWork/basicSSDLProject.

(Unix) You'll need SDL2, SDL2_Image, SDL2_Mixer, and SDL2_TTF installed.  
If you copy libssdl.so into an appropriate folder (say, the same one where 
SDL2*'s libraries are), you can skip ./runx and run the program as ./a.out; to
debug, you can skip ./dddx and ./gdbx and debug with ddd a.out or gdb a.out.


========== Possible problems running example programs ==========

If the system says it can't find SSDL or (MinGW/Visual Studio) SDL2, be sure you 
haven't moved the folder from its position in this code repository. 

If a Unix system complains it can't find SDL2, try reinstalling SDL2.

Microsoft Visual Studio builds:

If you Build All on a solution that shares source files, you may get a 
complaint that it is unable to build one or more project; but successive 
Build Alls will get them all.  This is because it is trying to build in 
parallel.  To fix this, Tools > Options > Projects and 
Solutions > Build and Run; set maximum number of parallel builds to 1.

You may get complaints while building that it cannot find the PDB's for 
SSDL, SDL*, or various other .lib's or .dll's.  You can ignore these.
