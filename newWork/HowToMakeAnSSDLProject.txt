How do you create a project that works with Lazy Programmers source code?

MinGW:  

Copy the basicSSDLProject folder in the newWork subfolder, and rename it appropriately; 
keep it in this newWork folder so the relative paths to the
include and library directories still work.  Rename its Makefile.mingw to Makefile, and type make.
To run, type bash mingw

Unix:

Copy the basicSSDLProject folder in the newWork subfolder, and rename it appropriately.  
Rename its Makefile.unix to Makefile, and type make.
To run, type ./runx

Microsoft Visual Studio:

Either

Copy the basicSSDLProject or basicSSDLProjectForVS2019 folder in the newWork subfolder, and rename it appropriately; 4
keep it in this newWork folder so the relative paths to the include and library directories still work.

or

Create one like it, thus.  Start with Empty Project, and alter Project Properties.
The following (except as stated below) applies to All Configurations.

* Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories should
  have paths to include files for SDL2, SDL2_Image, SDL2_Mixer, SDL2_ttf, and SSDL.
* Configuration Properties > C/C++ > Code Generation > Runtime Library should be
  /MTd if you are doing a Debug build;
  /MT  if you are doing a Release build.
* Configuration Properties > Linker > General > Additional Library Directories should
  have paths to library files for SDL2, SDL2_Image, SDL2_Mixer, SDL2_ttf, and SSDL.
* Configuration Properties > Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies should contain
  ssdl$(Configuration).lib (that is, ssdl_Debug.lib or ssdl_Release.lib depending
  on which you're doing), as well as
  sdl2.lib;SDL2main.lib;sdl2_image.lib;sdl2_ttf.lib;sdl2_mixer.lib.
* Configuration Properties > Linker > System > SubSystem should be set to
  Windows (/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS)
