//What's this crazy stuff here?  I need to ensure that SSDL_Display::Instance()
// is called (thus initializing SDL among other things) before main starts.
//This will do it.  Why do I care?  In case someone does something in main
// with an SDL feature like mouse cursor that I am not supporting.  It won't
// work till SDL is initialized.  Now it is.

//Weakness:  what if they do this SDL feature globally?  Then order of initialization
// is not guaranteed by C++.  But if they know enough to use an SDL feature, they
// should know enough not to do things with it before SDL is initialized.  So there.
