	// causes the horrible staticky sound I was hearing.  And the usual default format,
	// MIX_DEFAULT_FORMAT, equalled one of these!  I tried AUDIO_U8 and it worked.

	//Here's a decent discussion of how to choose freq; you can also play with chunk size

//An SSDL_SoundSystemInitialize is there to make it easy  to change the paramters to SDL_Mixer's
//  Mix_OpenAudio, without messing with SSDL code.  
//  It is completely optional -- just there if the programmer wants to tweak Mix_OpenAudio's arguments.

//  You call it thus, after includes in the main program, but before ANYTHING else gets done.  
//  SSDL_SoundSystemInitialize initializer(88020, MIX_DEFAULT_FORMAT,2, 4096); -- alter args as you like
//  If you call it twice, it should ignore the second call. Best call it once, in the file w/ main program.

//  Discussion of best arguments:  It seems conventional for the first argument to be some multiple of
//  220005 Hz.  I found 44010 to introduce static.
//  Changing chunkSize up or down by a factor of 2 showed no noticeable effect

//  Changing the format to AUDIO_U8 or AUDIO_S8 didn't sound good
//  Changing it to AUDIO_U16LSB, AUDIO_S16LSB, AUDIO_U16MSB, and AUDIO_S16MSB showed no change I could tell
