//This is a collection of functions for drawing shapes.  I'm trying to make it look a lot like SDL
// for training-wheels purposes.  General rule shall be:

//SSDL_function (args)
//means
//if (SDL_function (Renderer*, args)) fails, throw SSDL_Exception ()
//Exception:  if we're passing in an argument by const *, I pass it in by const &

//Note that SDL doesn't have a built-in method for drawing a circle -- so I'm adding one
